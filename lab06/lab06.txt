---Exercise 6.1---
a.) Identify the request methods that you can and can’t test using the two tools listed above. If a method cannot be testing using a particular tool, explain why this is the case. List the Curl commands you used successfully.
	Only GET requests show up in the browser; for the rest, you have to use curl.
	Curl commands used successfully:
		curl -X GET localhost:3000
		curl -X HEAD localhost:3000/ -I
		curl -X POST localhost:3000
		curl -X PUT localhost:3000/request
		curl -X DELETE localhost:3000/request
		curl -X PUT localhost:3000/request -d '{"cake":"chocolate"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
		curl -X DELETE localhost:3000/request -d '{"cake":"chocolate"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
		curl -X POST localhost:3000 -d '{"unicorn":"meow"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'



b.) What is the most appropriate HTTP response code for pages that aren’t defined by an Express route?
	I really want to say 418 ("I'm a teapot"), but I feel like 501 ("Not Implemented") or 400 ("Bad Request") is probably a more correct answer to this question (since the lab instructions previously stated not to use 404 ("Not Found")).



---Exercise 6.2---
a.) What HTTP methods do forms support?
		GET, POST


b.) How is the form data being passed back to the server and what syntactic form does it take? Is the data modified in any way?
		The form data is being passed back to the server via the HTTP POST method. The server receives it as a list of key/value items.
		The data is not modified in any way.
