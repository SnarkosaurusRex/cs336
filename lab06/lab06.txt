---Exercise 6.1---
a.) Identify the request methods that you can and can’t test using the two tools listed above. If a method cannot be testing using a particular tool, explain why this is the case. List the Curl commands you used successfully.
	Only GET requests show up in the browser; for the rest, you have to use curl.
	Curl commands used successfully:
		curl -X GET localhost:3000
		curl -X POST localhost:3000
		curl -X PUT localhost:3000/request
		curl -X DELETE localhost:3000/request

	This is what happened when I tried to run the HEAD command:
		ljh27@gold22:~/cs336/cs336/lab06$ curl -X HEAD localhost:3000
		Warning: Setting custom HTTP method to HEAD with -X/--request may not work the 
		Warning: way you want. Consider using -I/--head instead.
		curl: (18) transfer closed with 13 bytes remaining to read



b.) What is the most appropriate HTTP response code for pages that aren’t defined by an Express route?
