		<h3>Answers for the lab 3 exercises:</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>Exercise 3.1:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>a.) Both Node.js and Express.js are for running JavaScript server-side. Express.js is a framework based on the Node.js platform for building web applications; as the Express website says, "Express provides a thin layer of fundamental web application features".</li>
				<br/>
				<li>b.) The purpose of the package.json file is to define dependencies, build processes, and run scripts.</li>
			</ul>
			<br/>
			<li>Exercise 3.2:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>a.) These files are "static" in the sense that they don't change during the process of serving.</li>
				<br/>
				<li>b.) The server will serve up the hello-world message whenever it is requested. It is not served up constantly though - once it is served up the first time, it does not get served up again until it receives another request for it (i.e., you reload the page).</li>
			</ul>
